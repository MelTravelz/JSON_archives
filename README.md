# THE JSON ARCHIVES

## Welcome 
Hello and congrats for your determination to expand your coding muscles! The intention of this practice repository is to provide an opportunity for us to manipulate JSON and write code with different limitations and restrictions. 

Please note that this is a work in progress. I will be adding additional directories of JSON files and challenges in the coming months (2023). I would love to see your solutions and welcome feedback on the overall idea and/or the small details you find. (My contact details can be found on my [GitHub Profile Page](https://github.com/MelTravelz).) I also encourage you all to create a small group of peers and work through these individually but at the same time; then compare your wildly different solutions!

As Sandi Metz states in her book *Practical Object-Oriented Design*, "Now that you know the rules [of coding], you can bend them to your own purposes. Persist. Practice. Experiment. Imagine. Do your best work, and all else will follow."

## This is how we do it, yea!

The most basic instructions for all of the Options below are as follows: 
- Open and read the JSON file
- Parse through the data
- Do some fancy-pantsy logic as described by the challenge README
- Return JSON

Additionally:
- For each Option below, work with the JSON file labeled "clean" first.
- Once you have your code up and running, try importing the JSON file labeled "edgy." (This should break everything... but fear not! You are a Software Developer and you solve problems, you refactor code, and you will get it working once again!)

Within each directory here, you'll see an additional README with the challenge details and the JSON files you need. Solve the challenge with the Option 1 restrictions, then Option 2, and then Option 3. Choose any language/framework you like.

And do not pressure yourself to finish all in one day! Maybe complete an Option a day. Make sure you drink water, step outside occationally, and take 5-minutes breaks as you work. You got this!

### Option 1: Very Tech-Challenging
You find yourself in the hot seat of a technical challenge: You've been asked to focus on writing a method that delivers the data asked for. However, you've been instructed NOT to write tests, NOT to make classes, and NOT to use pry. Deep breath... you got this!

**Helpful Hint:** `pp` will pretty print to the terminal!

### Option 2: You're so Classy
Goodness! After finishing Option 1, let us all take a moment and pause in appreciation of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). This time around, you've been asked to go ahead and build out classes. NICE. Think of all the possibilities this opens up now! (Note: Writing tests is still optional just for time's sake.)

**Helpful Hint:** Refresh yourself on the 4 pillars of OOP and which principles can you incorporate! When was the last time you used a runner file, modules, inheritance, pagination?

---

### Option 3: Home Sweet Home
Ahhh, the Take-Home. You've been asked to spin up a repo of your own (in your preferred language and framework) and let your imagination run wild. Build out an API that delivers the desired data, and then, what other ideas do you have? Maybe a database? Maybe full CRUD functionality? Maybe just a micro service?

**Helpful Hint:** You are a problem-solver and critical-thinker. As long as you can defend your decisions, they will be impressed!

## Questions to Consider
Now, I know once you open up that first challenge you're gonna have a million questions... *"Do you want this as an integer or float?" "How should the return hash be structured - similar to how it comes in or the least nested as possible?" "Should I break this into helper methods immediately or wait until a refactor?"* 

The challenges are intentionally vague: Create a list of your own Clarification Questions that you would want to ask an interviewer or senior manager. Then make decisions, pseudocode your ideas, and allow all that to guide your work.

Again, I highly recommend you create a group of peers that work at the same time so you can compare the decisions you made and how that created code completely different from one another. You'll learn so, so much more this way! Happy Coding!
